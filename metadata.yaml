description: "Barchester Towers, published in 1857, is the second novel in Anthony\
  \ Trollope's series known as the \"Chronicles of Barsetshire\". Among other things\
  \ it satirises the then raging antipathy in the Church of England between High Church\
  \ and Evangelical adherents. Trollope began writing this book in 1855. He wrote\
  \ constantly, and made himself a writing-desk so he could continue writing while\
  \ travelling by train. \"Pray know that when a man begins writing a book he never\
  \ gives over,\" he wrote in a letter during this period. \"The evil with which he\
  \ is beset is as inveterate as drinking – as exciting as gambling.\" And, years\
  \ later in his autobiography, he observed \"In the writing of Barchester Towers\
  \ I took great delight. The bishop and Mrs. Proudie were very real to me, as were\
  \ also the troubles of the archdeacon and the loves of Mr. Slope.\" But when he\
  \ submitted his finished work, his publisher, William Longman, initially turned\
  \ it down, finding much of it to be full of \"vulgarity and exaggeration\". More\
  \ recent critics offer a more sanguine opinion. \"Barchester Towers is many readers'\
  \ favourite Trollope\", wrote The Guardian, which included it in its list of \"\
  1000 novels everyone must read\".\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
